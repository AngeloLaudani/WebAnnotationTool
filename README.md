Web Applications have long been treated as the driving force of the Internet only, but in today's society they have become crucial for every project that aims to interact with as many people as possible. This paper illustrates the realization of a rich internet application, using all the modern web development best practices and technologies, based on the Annotation Tool created by the Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision (PeRCeiVe Lab) of the University of Catania. With an intuitive and appealing front-end, a high efficient and advanced back-end (created with the powerful PHP Framework Laravel) and a solid and easy extensible database structure, the so created “Web Annotation Tool” allows users to perform ontology-driven annotations online, while gaining all the benefits and features of a web-based application.
